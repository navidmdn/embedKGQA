## embedKGQA in tf2

This is the code for our ACL 2020 paper [Improving Multi-hop Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs using Knowledge Base Embeddings](https://malllabiisc.github.io/publications/papers/final_embedkgqa.pdf) in tensorflow 2.
The original implementation of the project in pytroch is [here](https://github.com/malllabiisc/EmbedKGQA).
Also note that this implementation uses [metaQA dataset](https://github.com/yuyuz/MetaQA)
