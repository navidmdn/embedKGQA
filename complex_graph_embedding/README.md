# complex_graph_embedding in tf2

This repo is an implementation of complEx graph embedding for link prediction in tensorflow 2.

[Here](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/trouillon16.pdf) is a link to the original paper. I have implemented two scoring functions (DistMult and ComplEx) in the model, you can extend the model by adding new scoring functions too.

In this project I have used the complEx model to extract embeddings out of [metaqa](https://github.com/yuyuz/MetaQA) knowledge base.
